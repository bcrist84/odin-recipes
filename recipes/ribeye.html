<h2>Delicious Smoked Ribeye</h2>

<p>Welcome steak lovers!  If you love steak and want
    to take it to the next level this is an easy way
    to do that.  For this recipe you will need a way to 
    smoke.  A pellet grill, traditional smoker, or a 
    propane grill with a smoke tube.  I personally use
    a pellet grill for this recipe.  What we want is low 
    temp and a slower cook.  So we can get enough of a smokey
    flavor added into our steak.  Go ahead and choose your 
    choice of wood.  We are going to want our temp around 
    225 degrees.
</p>

<p>For the steak I wouldn't go with anything less than 
    an inch and half thick.  Because we are smoking the steak,
    the thicker the steak the longer we will be able to smoke 
    the steak.  So with that said time will vary depending on
    the thickness of the steak.  I personally don't go by time,
    but temp pulling the steak when it is at 115 to 120 degrees.
    Once the steak hits pulling temp.  I sear the steak at a high
    temp.
