  <h2>Delicious BBQ Chicken</h2>
  <p>Growing up I loved eating bbq chicken.  It was something of a holiday
    tradition.  I would go from Memorial day to 4th of July waiting for some bbq chicken.  Now that I'm all
    grown I no longer have to wait for a holiday and cook it quite often.
  </p>
  <p>This is a very simple recipe using chicken thighs and bbq sauce.  Cooking low and
    slow on a grill.  I use a pellet grill.  I love it for it's ease of temperature set
    and smokey flavor it adds.
  </p>
  <P>I buy the packs of 10 boneless chicken thighs.  If you have a big bowl throw them
    in and take a half cup of your favorite bbq sauce, throw that in.  Toss the chicken til
    they are all coated and let sit.  Fire up the grill to 225 degrees.  If you are using
    smoke to add more flavor, this is a good time to get that going too. Now that the grill
    is all ready.  Grab the chicken and lay it out on the grill.  I put bbq sauce in a bowl
    with a bbq brush.  Every 20 mins I apply bbq sauce then flip the chicken.  Repeat, til
    meat thermometer reads 165 degrees then pull chicken from grill and let rest for 5 to
    10 mins.
