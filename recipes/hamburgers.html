    <h2>Juicy Half Pound Hamburgers</h2>
    <p>This is a juicy one. I love hamburgers, big thick burgers. I make nothing less than
        a half pound burger. It cooks to the perfect doneness for me and remains rediculously
        juicy. They also reheat well keeping juicy.
    </p>
    <p>For this recipe. I don't measure anything, its all by eyeballing it. Because of this
        the flavors for the burgers do vary from make to make. I might eventually measure
        out ingredients. So the flavor is more consistent. When I do the ingredients list
        will be updated with amounts.
    </p>
    <p>Lets get started.  I start out with 2lbs of burger. It's your choice of cut of meat
        and fat percentage. I go with either 80-20 ground beef. Or a prime cut of meat ground
        into burger. Place the burger into a big bowl to mix. The seasonings that I mix
        into the burger are cayenne pepper becuase I like a little kick of spice. Paprika,
        chile powder, garlic (minced, granules, or powder), ground pepper, salt, 
        and worcestershire sauce. If I'm not topping the burger with onions. I will add in
        onion (granules, or powder). Mix everything really well and form into half pound
        patties. I use a food scale for accurate weight. Now lets get the grill ready. We 
        will be grilling these at a low temp of 225 degrees. If you want even more flavor
        we can add in a source of smoke since it is a slower cook. When the grill is heated
        up, throw the burgers on. We wont flip the burgers any during the cook only at the 
        sear. It's really handy to have a meat thermometer. I use a Thermapen and really 
        like it. Once your burgers are close to the disired doneness. It is time to finish with
        a sear. Crank the heat up and sear one side than the other putting cheese on as
        soon as you start searing the final side. Remove from grill and let rest for a few 
        minutes before digging into these flavorful hamburgers.
